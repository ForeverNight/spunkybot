# Community Information & Contributing

If you want to get involved, whether in terms of asking a question, helping other users, introducing new people to Spunky Bot, or helping with the software or documentation, we appreciate your contributions to the project.

## Contributing Code (Features or Bugfixes)

The Spunky Bot project keeps its source on GitHub at [github.com/SpunkyBot/spunkybot](https://github.com/SpunkyBot/spunkybot).

The project takes contributions through GitHub pull requests.

In order to keep the history clean and better audit of incoming code, we will require resubmission of pull requests that contain merge commits. Use "git pull -rebase" vs "git pull" and "git rebase" vs "git merge". Also make sure to use topic branches to keep your additions on different branches, such that they will not make conflicting commits later.

We will then review your contributions and discuss issues with you.

Be patient, your request might not get merged right away, we also try to keep the development branch more or less usable, so we like to examine pull requests carefully, which takes time.

Patches should always be made against the 'develop' branch.

Keep in mind that small and focused requests are easier to check and accept, having example cases also help us understand the utility of a bug fix or a new feature.

Contributions can be for new features like modules, or to fix bugs you or others have found.

We like simple, readable code and consistent, conservatively extending, backwards-compatible improvements. The code developed for Spunky Bot must support Python 2.6+. Please also use a 4-space indent and no tabs. We do not enforce 80 characters lines, we are fine with 120-160.

## Mailing List Information

The Spunky Bot [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/group/spunkybot) is for sharing tips, answering questions, and general user discussions.

## Community Code of Conduct

The Spunky Bot community welcomes users of all types, backgrounds, and skill levels. Please treat others in the way you expect to be treated, keep discussions positive and avoid discrimination of any kinds, profanity, or engaging in controversial debates.

Posts to mailing lists should remain focused on Spunky Bot and game server administration. Abuse of these community guidelines is not tolerated and may result in banning from community resources.
